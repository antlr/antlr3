<!--

    This is the assembly descriptor for building a full source code
    distribution of ANTLR and all its related components. This assmebly
    only includes the Java oriented source code, hence only the Java runtime
    is included in the resulting jar.

    The resulting jar is distribution that can be expanded with:

      jar xvf antlr-master-3.x.x-src.jar

    The output directory will be antlr-master-3.x.x and in here will be
    the BUILD.txt fie, which explains how to build ANTLR.
