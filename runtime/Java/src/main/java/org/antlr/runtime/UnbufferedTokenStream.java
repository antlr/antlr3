/** A token stream that pulls tokens from the code source on-demand and

 *
 *  You can't use this stream if you pass whitespace or other off-channel
 *  tokens to the parser. The stream can't ignore off-channel tokens.
 * 
 *  You can only look backwards 1 token: LT(-1).
 *
 *  Use this when you need to read from a socket or other infinite stream.
