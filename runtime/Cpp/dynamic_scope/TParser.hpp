/** \file
 *  This C++ header file was generated by $ANTLR version 3.4
 *
 *     -  From the grammar source file : T.g
 *     -                            On : 2012-02-26 10:26:07
 *     -                for the parser : TParserParser
 *
 * Editing it, at least manually, is not wise.
 *
 * C++ language generator and runtime by Gokulakannan Somasundaram ( heavy lifting from C Run-time by Jim Idle )
 *
 *
 * The parser 
TParser

has the callable functions (rules) shown below,
 * which will invoke the code for the associated rule in the source grammar
 * assuming that the input stream is pointing to a token/text stream that could begin
 * this rule.
 *
 * For instance if you call the first (topmost) rule in a parser grammar, you will
 * get the results of a full parse, but calling a rule half way through the grammar will
 * allow you to pass part of a full token stream to the parser, such as for syntax checking
 * in editors and so on.
