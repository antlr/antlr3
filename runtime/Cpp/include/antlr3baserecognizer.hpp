	/// follow that rule reference on the stack; this amounts to
	/// computing FIRST of what follows the rule reference in the
	/// enclosing rule. This local follow set only includes tokens
	/// from within the rule; i.e., the FIRST computation done by
	/// ANTLR stops at the end of a rule.
	//
	/// EXAMPLE
	//
	/// When you find a "no viable alt exception", the input is not
	/// consistent with any of the alternatives for rule r.  The best
	/// thing to do is to consume tokens until you see something that
	/// can legally follow a call to r *or* any rule that called r.
	/// You don't want the exact set of viable next tokens because the
	/// input might just be missing a token--you might consume the
	/// rest of the input looking for one of the missing tokens.
	///
	/// Consider grammar:
	///
	/// a : '[' b ']'
	///   | '(' b ')'
	///   ;
	/// b : c '^' INT ;
	/// c : ID
	///   | INT
	///   ;
	///
	/// At each rule invocation, the set of tokens that could follow
	/// that rule is pushed on a stack.  Here are the various "local"
	/// follow sets:
	///
	/// FOLLOW(b1_in_a) = FIRST(']') = ']'
	/// FOLLOW(b2_in_a) = FIRST(')') = ')'
	/// FOLLOW(c_in_b) = FIRST('^') = '^'
	///
	/// Upon erroneous input "[]", the call chain is
	///
	/// a -> b -> c
	///
	/// and, hence, the follow context stack is:
	///
	/// depth  local follow set     after call to rule
	///   0         <EOF>                    a (from main())
	///   1          ']'                     b
	///   3          '^'                     c
	///
	/// Notice that ')' is not included, because b would have to have
	/// been called from a different context in rule a for ')' to be
	/// included.
	///
	/// For error recovery, we cannot consider FOLLOW(c)
	/// (context-sensitive or otherwise).  We need the combined set of
	/// all context-sensitive FOLLOW sets--the set of all tokens that
	/// could follow any reference in the call chain.  We need to
	/// resync to one of those tokens.  Note that FOLLOW(c)='^' and if
	/// we resync'd to that token, we'd consume until EOF.  We need to
	/// sync to context-sensitive FOLLOWs for a, b, and c: {']','^'}.
	/// In this case, for input "[]", LA(1) is in this set so we would
	/// not consume anything and after printing an error rule c would
	/// return normally.  It would not find the required '^' though.
	/// At this point, it gets a mismatched token error and throws an
	/// exception (since LA(1) is not in the viable following token
	/// set).  The rule exception handler tries to recover, but finds
	/// the same recovery set and doesn't consume anything.  Rule b
	/// exits normally returning to rule a.  Now it finds the ']' (and
	/// with the successful match exits errorRecovery mode).
	///
	/// So, you can see that the parser walks up call chain looking
	/// for the token that was a member of the recovery set.
	///
	/// Errors are not generated in errorRecovery mode.
	///
	/// ANTLR's error recovery mechanism is based upon original ideas:
	///
	/// "Algorithms + Data Structures = Programs" by Niklaus Wirth
	///
	/// and
	///
	/// "A note on error recovery in recursive descent parsers":
	/// http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=947902.947905
	///
	/// Later, Josef Grosch had some good ideas:
	///
	/// "Efficient and Comfortable Error Recovery in Recursive Descent
	/// Parsers":
	/// ftp://www.cocolab.com/products/cocktail/doca4.ps/ell.ps.zip
	///
	/// Like Grosch I implemented local FOLLOW sets that are combined
	/// at run-time upon error to avoid overhead during parsing.
	///
    BitsetType*	computeErrorRecoverySet();

    /// Compute the context-sensitive FOLLOW set for current rule.
	/// Documentation below is from the Java runtime.
	///
	/// This is the set of token types that can follow a specific rule
	/// reference given a specific call chain.  You get the set of
	/// viable tokens that can possibly come next (look ahead depth 1)
	/// given the current call chain.  Contrast this with the
	/// definition of plain FOLLOW for rule r:
	///
	///  FOLLOW(r)={x | S=>*alpha r beta in G and x in FIRST(beta)}
	///
	/// where x in T* and alpha, beta in V*; T is set of terminals and
	/// V is the set of terminals and non terminals.  In other words,
	/// FOLLOW(r) is the set of all tokens that can possibly follow
	/// references to r in///any* sentential form (context).  At
	/// runtime, however, we know precisely which context applies as
	/// we have the call chain.  We may compute the exact (rather
	/// than covering superset) set of following tokens.
	///
	/// For example, consider grammar:
	///
	/// stat : ID '=' expr ';'      // FOLLOW(stat)=={EOF}
	///      | "return" expr '.'
	///      ;
	/// expr : atom ('+' atom)* ;   // FOLLOW(expr)=={';','.',')'}
	/// atom : INT                  // FOLLOW(atom)=={'+',')',';','.'}
	///      | '(' expr ')'
	///      ;
	///
	/// The FOLLOW sets are all inclusive whereas context-sensitive
	/// FOLLOW sets are precisely what could follow a rule reference.
	/// For input input "i=(3);", here is the derivation:
	///
	/// stat => ID '=' expr ';'
	///      => ID '=' atom ('+' atom)* ';'
	///      => ID '=' '(' expr ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
	///      => ID '=' '(' atom ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
	///      => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
	///      => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ';'
	///
	/// At the "3" token, you'd have a call chain of
	///
	///   stat -> expr -> atom -> expr -> atom
	///
	/// What can follow that specific nested ref to atom?  Exactly ')'
	/// as you can see by looking at the derivation of this specific
	/// input.  Contrast this with the FOLLOW(atom)={'+',')',';','.'}.
	///
	/// You want the exact viable token set when recovering from a
	/// token mismatch.  Upon token mismatch, if LA(1) is member of
	/// the viable next token set, then you know there is most likely
	/// a missing token in the input stream.  "Insert" one by just not
	/// throwing an exception.

    /// Compute the current followset for the input stream.

    /// Attempt to recover from a single missing or extra token.
	///
	/// EXTRA TOKEN
	///
	/// LA(1) is not what we are looking for.  If LA(2) has the right token,
	/// however, then assume LA(1) is some extra spurious token.  Delete it
	/// and LA(2) as if we were doing a normal match(), which advances the
	/// input.
	///
	/// MISSING TOKEN
	///
	/// If current token is consistent with what could come after
	/// ttype then it is ok to "insert" the missing token, else throw
	/// exception For example, Input "i=(3;" is clearly missing the
	/// ')'.  When the parser returns from the nested call to expr, it
	/// will have call chain:
	///
	///    stat -> expr -> atom
	///
	/// and it will be trying to match the ')' at this point in the

	///
	///       => ID '=' '(' INT ')' ('+' atom)* ';'
	///                          ^
	/// match() will see that ';' doesn't match ')' and report a
	/// mismatched token error.  To recover, it sees that LA(1)==';'
	/// is in the set of tokens that can follow the ')' token
	/// reference in rule atom.  It can assume that you forgot the ')'.
